# Placeholder Images for Portfolio

To make the dynamic content feature work properly, you'll need to create or source the following images and place them in your `/public` folder:

## Required Images

1. **Default Image**
   - Already exists: `/defoor.png`
   - This is your current default image

2. **UX Design Image**
   - Create: `/ux-design.png`
   - Suggested content: A wireframe, UI design, or user flow diagram

3. **Development Image**
   - Create: `/development.png`
   - Suggested content: Code editor, development environment, or tech stack visualization

4. **Research Image**
   - Create: `/research.png`
   - Suggested content: User research session, affinity diagram, or research findings

5. **Projects Image**
   - Create: `/projects.png`
   - Suggested content: Portfolio piece, project showcase, or case study visual

6. **Testing Image**
   - Create: `/testing.png`
   - Suggested content: Usability testing session, heatmap, or testing results

## Image Specifications

- All images should be the same dimensions for consistent display
- Recommended size: Match the dimensions of your existing `/defoor.png` image
- Format: PNG or JPG (PNG preferred for transparency support)
- Style: Keep a consistent visual style across all images

## Temporary Solution

Until you create these custom images, you can:

1. Duplicate your existing `/defoor.png` file and rename the copies to match the required filenames
2. Use stock images or AI-generated images as placeholders
3. Create simple colored rectangles with text labels as minimal placeholders

Remember to replace these placeholders with your actual portfolio content when available.
