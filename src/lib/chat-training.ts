// Additional context for specific areas
export const additionalContext = {
  designPhilosophy: `
    My design philosophy is that complex problems require simple solutions. Simple solutions that are backed by an array of in depth research and testing. I approach new design challenges by thoroughly understanding the user's needs through comprehensive research and interviews, then iteratively design solutions that balance business objectives with optimal user experience.
  `,
  
  developmentApproach: `
    My development workflow is interesting because most of the projects I work on either I designed the screens or someone poorly designed some screens and it was my job to improve them while developing them. So either I am pulling in components from the design system I made to perfectly match the screens I created, or because of timeline I'm acting as a designer and developer at the same time thinking through how I can improve the screens while building them.
  `,
  
  researchMethods: `
    It really depends on the project, if it's an internal one we like to do stakeholder and user interviews to get tons of feedback and requirements and then continuously test through the lifespan of the project. As for consumer things we like to do all that stuff and also do concept validation. I consolidate data into thematic insights, identify common pain points, and prioritize actionable recommendations using affinity mapping and detailed synthesis.
  `,
  
  projectManagement: `
    In my role we have so many projects we have to work on at once that I really have to prioritize by impact and deadline. Higher visibility will always take priority over lower ones. I handle tight deadlines by focusing on the highest-impact tasks first, ensuring clear communication with stakeholders, and leveraging efficient processes like automation and rapid prototyping.
  `,
  
  careerGoals: `
    My short-term career goals are to deepen my expertise in AI-driven design, enhance my leadership skills, and contribute to impactful, cutting-edge projects. I'm currently strengthening my skills in advanced front-end development, specifically in Next.js, and expanding my knowledge of AI and machine learning integrations in UX/UI. My vision includes leading innovative teams that create groundbreaking, user-focused digital products, and eventually taking on executive roles driving strategic UX direction across industries.

    - Complex data visualization design for predictive analytics
    - Creating intuitive interfaces for complex data relationships
    - Extensive user research with data analysts to understand their needs
    - Iterative testing and refinement of visualization patterns
    - Integration with existing systems and data sources
